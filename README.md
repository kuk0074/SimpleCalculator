# SimpleCalculator
Hi everyone. This is code of simple calculator which can divide, multiplicate, sum, and substract two numbers entered by user. 
Over time I will try to improve this application if something come to my head. 
To create this app I used basic knowledge of OOP, try/catch exceptions, while() statement and simple interface 
which has been implemented to class Division, Multiplication, Sum, Substraction.
